    <!-- Paragraphs is the place where we stored the text -->
    <p>The Shih Tzu is a sturdy little dog with a small muzzle and normally has large dark brown eyes. The Chinese have
        described their head shapes as "owl head" and "lion head", and their mouth as "frog mouth".[4] They have a soft
        and long double coat that will tangle and mat easily if not brushed at least every 2 or 3 days. A Shih Tzu
        should stand no more than 26.7 cm (10½") at the withers and with an ideal weight of 4.0 to 7.5 kg (9 to 17 lb).
        Floppy ears are covered with long fur, and the heavily furred tail is carried curled over the back. The coat may
        be of any color, though white and with blazes of grey are frequently seen. A very noticeable feature is the
        underbite, which is required in the breed standard.[5]</p>


    <p>The traditional long silky coat, which tends to reach the floor, requires daily brushing to avoid tangles.
        Because of their long coat and fast-growing hair, regular grooming is necessary and important, which may be
        expensive and should be taken into account when considering adopting one of this breed. Often, the coat is
        clipped short to simplify care, but the coat still requires daily brushing. For conformation showing, the coat
        must be left in its natural state, though trimming for neatness around the feet and anus is allowed. The shorter
        cut is typically called a "puppy cut"[6] or a "teddy bear cut" when the puppy cut is accompanied by a fuller,
        rounder face, resembling a cute and cuddly stuffed animal.</p>

    <h2 class="second">Etymology</h2>

    <p>The name comes from the Chinese language word for "lion" because this kind of dog was bred to resemble "the lion,
        as in traditional oriental art".[7] (The Pekingese breed is also called 獅子狗 "lion dog" in Chinese.) "Shih Tzu"
        is the Wade-Giles romanization of the Chinese characters 獅子 "lion".</p>

    <p>In contemporary mandarin, the Shih Tzu is generally known as the "Xi Shi dog"; Xi Shi was regarded as one of the
        most beautiful women of ancient China. Shih Tzu were nicknamed the Chrysanthemum Dog in England in the 1930s.[8]
        The dog may also be called the Tibetan Lion Dog, but whether the breed should be referred to as "Tibetan" or
        "Chinese" is a source of both historical and political contention, as the subsequent section notes. A book on
        the breed states that "dog historians tend to have very strong opinions" on the subject.[9]</p>

    <h2 class="third">History</h2>

    <p>One theory is that the Shih Tzu descended from a cross between the Pekingese and Lhasa Apso.[10] The dogs were
        favorites of the Chinese royals and so prized that, for years, the Chinese refused to sell, trade, or give any
        away. The first dogs of the breed were imported into Europe (England and Norway) in 1930 and were classified by
        the Kennel Club as "Apsos".[10] The first European standard for the breed was written in England in 1935 by the
        Shih Tzu Club,[11] and the dogs were categorised again as Shih Tzu. The breed spread throughout Europe and was
        brought to the United States after World War II, when returning members of the U.S. military brought back dogs
        from Europe and Asia, in the mid-1950s. The Shih Tzu was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1969 in the
        Toy Group.[10]There are fourteen total iterations of the Shih Tzu in the breed's gene pool today.[12]In 1934,
        the Shih Tzu Club of England was founded[13] and the breed was officially recognised by the Kennel Club (UK) on
        7 May 1940. When it became eligible for Challenge Certificates, none were awarded until 1949. The breed is now
        recognized by all of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world.[5] It is also recognized by the
        Fédération Cynologique Internationale for international competition in Companion and Toy Dog Group, Section 5,
        Tibetan breeds.[5] In the United States, the Shih Tzu ranked the 15th most popular breed in 2013, falling
        slightly in popularity since 2012 when it was placed in 11th position.</p>
